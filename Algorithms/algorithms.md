# Graphs - major

- strongly connected connected components using DFS.
- Bi connected graph - if any point is removed the graph is still connected.
- Articulation point or cut vertices - if that node is removed, graph is not connected. or component is increased

## DFS 
- how to connect the graph.
    - adjacency matrix
